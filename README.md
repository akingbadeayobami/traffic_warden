### Traffic Warden

This project is born out of the need to build something off my knowledge of the Phoenix framework.

This project features:
- Users be able to post their traffic situation.
- Other users will able to vote them up or down based on its validity
- Each post will able to have only a first level comment
- All actions will be processed in real-time
